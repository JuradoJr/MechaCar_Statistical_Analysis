### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance were the ground_clearance and vehicle_length variables. They both had very small P-values and had a high significance level of 0 ‘***’.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model should not be considered zero due to there being independent variables that have an effect on the dependent variable.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model can predict the MechaCar prototypes effectively due to having an r-squared value of 0.7149 which means it is 71% accurate.
